<p> This is Brett Eldredge, like Keith Urban he is also a counrty Artist, in fact I met him while he was on tour with keith. Now as you can probably see in the picture Brett is over six feet tall and towers over me. Brett was extremely nice and he even remembers the fans he meets. Just like Keith he has an amazing fan base and is an amazing performer and an inspiration to many. My favorite song by Brett is called Drunk On Your Love, I just like many others have been stuck in love with someone and this used to be a song that made me fall in love with her over and over again, but she left and it bacame a memory and my favorite song of his.</P>
