<P>History Major student at the University of Maine</P>


<p>My name is Jason this is alittle about myself. I am 19 years old from the good old state of Massachusetts. I'm a student at the University of Maine in Orono, with an  attraction to the history of this country, which made me take up history for my major. I love learning about World War 1 and 2. Living and growing up in Massachusetts I have a love for all the Boston sports teams, the Red Soxs, Patriots, Bruins, and Celtics. I've been to all types of sports games but want to get to a bruins game. I lived on Cape Cod for awhile and while attending Wareham High School, I learned my purpose in life early, the four years went by faster then I can remember. Most of my teachers from then won't see this but I want to thank them for making me the man I am today and for getting me here and never giving up. </p>
